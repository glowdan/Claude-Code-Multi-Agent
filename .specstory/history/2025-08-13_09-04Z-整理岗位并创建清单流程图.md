<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning project implementation**

I need to operate within the repo at /ssd/glowdan/Claude-Code-Multi-Agent. The user mentioned that there's a file in the agents directory explaining each role. My next step is to identify the necessary roles for the project, create a sequence for implementation, and produce a flowchart to include in the plan.md file.

The requirements highlight creating a WeChat mini-program that allows making checklist templates and managing tasks. I'll explore the agents directory and that roles file, generating the plan.md with a Mermaid diagram. I'll perform parallel tool calls, starting with a brief status update.
**Executing directory listings**

I need to use codebase_search to find "agents role description," but since filenames are important, I'll start by running list_dir for the agents directory and possibly the repo root. I'll also search for plan.md, creating it if it doesn't exist. 

To streamline this, I can use multi_tool_use.parallel, listing the root, the agents directory, and looking for plan.md. Let’s go ahead and execute these actions!</details></think>

我先快速浏览一下仓库的 `agents` 目录和相关说明文件，确认有哪些岗位可选，然后会创建/更新仓库根目录下的 `plan.md`，写入一个适合你需求的流程图和执行顺序。接下来开始扫描目录与文件。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning the project implementation**

I’m considering what the user needs, which is to choose useful roles and establish an order for the project tasks. A flowchart will help illustrate this, and I plan to use a Mermaid diagram for clarity. I should then write this into a `plan.md` file. Previously, there were some issues with file access, but I can create a new file directly. Let’s ensure we include both the flowchart and the list of roles in the document.
**Drafting plan.md content**

I think plan.md should have the roles listing and the flowchart, although the requirements mention only including the flowchart. To keep it compliant, I’ll add a brief remark with the selected roles and an ordered list as a preface to the diagram. The flowchart should have a title and minimal notes to avoid clutter. I’ll also include Mermaid code fences. It’s smart to check the `agents/engineering/backend` and `frontend` folders for specialized roles like a "wechat mini program developer" using list_dir. I'll do this alongside checking the `project-management` roles.</details></think>

我将并行查看 `agents/engineering` 的子目录以确认是否有更贴合小程序的工程角色，并据此确定岗位清单与顺序。随后会创建或更新根目录的 `plan.md` 并写入流程图。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning role selection and flowchart**

I need to choose relevant roles from the agents directory to create WeChat Mini Program checklist templates, instantiate tasks, and mark them complete. My plan involves producing a flowchart for this in plan.md. I'll inspect the markdown files to ensure accurate role mapping without needing to open each one. We can create a new plan.md since the previous search attempt failed. I also need to include a flowchart using the functions.create_diagram tool for a Mermaid diagram!
**Selecting roles for Mermaid diagram**

The create_diagram tool gives a thumbs-up for pre-render validation. I’ll be creating a Mermaid graph and, while plan.md may not exist, I can make a new one. I should respect the existing markdown style, even though indentation isn't critical. For roles, I’m considering positions like sprint-prioritizer, trend-researcher, and product manager. I also need frontend and backend roles for building the WeChat Mini Program—maybe a backend-architect or backend-developer. Testing and deployment roles like test-automator and deployment-engineer will be included, along with design roles if necessary!
**Creating role list and flowchart**

I need to create a list of selected roles in order and include a flowchart in plan.md. The user specifically requested a flowchart to represent the steps, along with the roles arranged sequentially. So, plan.md should feature both the list and the flowchart. I want to confirm the titles and file names to use, ensuring clarity. To do this effectively, I’ll read through a few markdown files to verify roles and names, and I'll run a parallel read for multiple files. Let's open around 8-10 files!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Organizing project roles and features**

I’m considering various roles for our project, like backend and frontend developers or a testing automator. Tailwind CSS might not fit our mini program, so we’ll focus on a different design approach. We should organize our tasks by project phases, including product planning, API design, and testing.

I’m outlining user flows for managing templates and creating checklists, detailing backend endpoints like POST and GET requests. I might also create a flowchart with Mermaid to visualize this plan, including roles and task order in our documentation.
**Creating a new plan file**

I’m getting ready to implement a new plan.md since our earlier check for it didn’t succeed. I’ll first check the directory to ensure it’s not already there — it isn't, so I’ll create it. 

I’m considering if we need any additional roles, like a rapid prototyper or an architect reviewer, but I’m leaning towards simplicity. I’ll ensure proper formatting and use headings as per markdown standards while crafting the plan in Chinese. I can embed flowcharts as Mermaid code and validate them with the create_diagram tool if necessary.
**Drafting the project plan**

I’m creating a project plan using a code block in the file, titled "项目计划（微信小程序：清单模板/任务/完成标记）". The goal is to list the features and roles in order, including sprint-prioritizer, api-architect, backend-developer, frontend-developer, test-automator, project-shipper, and deployment-engineer. 

I might switch the order of the deployment-engineer and project-shipper, given our focus on local storage. I’ll outline user flows and system operations, detailing template management and task creation in the flowchart. Data storage options like LocalStorage will be included as well.
**Creating the flowchart in Mermaid**

I’m drafting a flowchart in Mermaid to visualize the user journey through our application. It starts from the user entering the mini program and includes actions like managing templates, creating checklists, and viewing checklist details. 

I want to add a data layer with storage options, indicating whether we’re using local storage or backend API. I’m thinking about representing the Templates and Checklists as database nodes that connect to this data layer. This way, the flowchart will clearly show how everything links together in the system.
**Finalizing the diagram and timeline**

I’m putting together a simple and clear diagram while including the event/data model, with fields for Templates and Checklists. I realize they’re looking for a flowchart, so I’ll keep it straightforward and not overly detailed. 

I’m outlining a timeline for our milestones, mapping roles to tasks, starting with the sprint-prioritizer defining criteria and moving through frontend scaffolding and testing. Now, I’ll create the plan.md file and apply the proper formatting since it’s markdown, ensuring the right indentation while keeping the code light. Time to proceed with that implementation!</details></think>

我将创建根目录下的 `plan.md`，写入岗位选择与执行顺序，以及一张覆盖模板/清单/完成标记的流程图（Mermaid）。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating flowchart status**

I need to produce a flowchart for plan.md, and I've already added the mermaid flowchart. My next step is to provide a status update and summary. I noticed there's no linter tool specifically for the markdown check, but the instructions say to use read_lints after code edits. It should work for plan.md, so I’ll go ahead and run read_lints to ensure everything is okay.</details></think>

我希望尽可能多的岗位参与进来，以此提升整体的效果

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating project roles**

I’m thinking about the marketing directory; the user wants a WeChat mini-program, but marketing isn't a core requirement. Still, I might suggest a minimal marketing role for the app store. For the WeChat app, distribution and content roles are essential. I might include a "search-specialist," but I need to keep things relevant.

I’ll update plan.md with an expanded flowchart, maybe using swimlanes in Mermaid to represent roles at each step. First, we need to ensure we have the correct design role names listed out.
**Listing project roles**

I need to include various roles for the project while keeping things relevant. For project management, I’m considering roles like project-shipper, studio-producer, and experiment-tracker. 

In engineering, I could list frontend roles like senior-frontend-architect and mobile-app-builder. Mid-level roles might be architect-review and code-reviewer, while backend includes backend-architect. For deployment, I’m thinking of roles like devops-troubleshooter and legacy-modernizer but will avoid those that aren’t applicable like payment-integration.

While the user wants many roles, it’s important they remain relevant for enhancing the project.
**Creating a multi-lane diagram**

I’m considering adding a second Mermaid diagram using a flowchart with swimlanes. Since Mermaid supports subgraphs for roles, I’ll create a multi-lane diagram representing different phases:

In the discovery phase, I'll include roles like product trend-researcher and ux-researcher. For design, I'll list ui-ux-master, ui-designer, and others. 

Then, there’s the architecture phase with backend and cloud architects; implementation with various developers; and testing roles for quality assurance. 

I also want to ensure this integrates well with our existing plan file and append a section titled "扩展岗位矩阵与协作流程" while preserving spacing.
**Implementing tool calls**

I’m planning to implement some tool calls now. First, I’ll read plan.md to ensure any modifications are correct. It’s not strictly necessary, but since we need to comply with the rule about reading files not viewed in the last five messages, it’s safer to do so.

Even though the file is open per "open_and_recently_viewed_files," it makes sense to read it again. After that, I’ll apply the patch to add a new section and check the Mermaid syntax for correctness. 

I’ll also consider updating the roles list and adding an expanded bullet list labeled "参与岗位（扩展）." Let's proceed with the status update, read the file, and apply the patch, followed by re-running read_lints on plan.md.</details></think>

我将扩展 `plan.md`：新增“参与岗位（扩展）”清单，并加入包含多岗位协作泳道的 Mermaid 流程图，覆盖从调研到发布与回访的全流程。随后检查格式无误。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating roles in plan.md**

I need to revise plan.md to incorporate more roles as the user requested. They want as many roles involved as possible to enhance overall effectiveness. I’ll aim to expand the section listing different roles across various areas like product, design, engineering, middleware, testing, deployment, and marketing. The agents directory has many specific roles I can reference for a comprehensive inclusion. I should also consider adding a multi-lane mermaid diagram to visualize these roles!
**Creating diagrams for roles**

I'm exploring how to use Mermaid to create flowcharts and sequence diagrams with subgraphs per role. I think I'll include roles in a "sequenceDiagram" and a flowchart with swimlanes, as the instructions suggest. The diagram will show roles like Product, UX, UI, Frontend, and others. I need to ensure my Mermaid syntax is correct and follow the developer instructions to use the apply_patch tool. I'll add the new section to plan.md, summarizing responsibilities and including file paths for each role in a bullet list!
**Expanding role diagrams**

I want to add more roles to the diagram and create a sequenceDiagram that outlines tasks from planning to iteration. The sequence will include steps like Design UX, UI design, Frontend development, and others. I’m considering whether to add roles like "orchestrators" or "agent-selector," but I shouldn't bloat the diagram. The user wants as many roles as possible, so I plan to include relevant roles across directories, like Product, Design, and Engineering. I’ll even add a Universal tailwind-css-expert if applicable!
**Finalizing role details**

I’m focusing on adding more roles for the diagram, especially in the backend, middleware, testing, deployment, project management, and marketing areas. For backend engineering, I’ll look at including a backend-architect and possibly an AI engineer as optional. The testing section can feature roles like test-automator and performance-benchmarker. I also want to run a directory list for marketing and studio operations to confirm file names before editing plan.md. That way, I can ensure I’m covering all relevant roles effectively!</details></think>

我会先快速列出 `agents/marketing`、`agents/studio-operations`、`agents/specialist`、`agents/specialized` 的岗位文件名，确保在扩展清单中引用准确的路径。随后我会更新 `plan.md`。
